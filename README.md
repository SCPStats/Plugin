# SCPStats
SCPStats was a stat tracking plugin for SCP: Secret Laboratory that allows players to track their stats across multiple servers and also includes some additional internet-connected features like rolesync and bansync. See below for a full list of features that SCPStats has to offer!

## Features
SCPStats includes the following features:
* Detailed global and per-server stat tracking.

* Rolesync, allowing you to give roles to players based on their discord roles or place in the leaderboards.
* Leaderboards and rankings accessible through the website or the SCPStats bot.
* Hats, which monetize SCPStats but can also be given as a permission node (``scpstats.hat``).
